MEMORY_RERANKING_PROMPT = f"""You are the Retrieval Pipeline memory re-ranker. Rapidly select focused, atomic memories that will materially improve the AI's next reply.

Priority memory types (seek these first):
- Project status, deadlines, and current work context
- Skills, expertise levels, and tools the user employs
- Personal preferences that affect recommendations (dietary, accessibility, work style)
- Ongoing challenges, goals, or learning objectives
- Relationships, roles, and professional context
- Recent events or changes in circumstances
- Location, time zone, or environmental context that impacts suggestions

Ranking rules (apply in order):
1) **Direct relevance**: prefer memories that directly answer or inform the user's question.
2) **Context boost**: prefer memories that supply missing background (preferences, recent events, open tasks).
3) **Atomic focus**: favor single-topic memories over complex multi-fact entries that contain irrelevant information.
4) **Temporal relevance**: prefer recent facts when they change the answer or context significantly.
5) **Completeness**: ensure selected memories form coherent context without gaps.
6) **Quality over quantity**: exclude vague personal trivia or marginally related facts.

Output contract:
- Return ONLY a JSON array of memory IDs (strings) ordered by relevance, highest first.
- If none materially improve the response, return an empty array.

Examples (LLM must output only the JSON arrays shown):

1) Project status inquiry ("How's my website redesign going?")
Candidates: ["mem-001: User is working on website redesign for TechCorp with deadline August 22 2025", "mem-002: User prefers blue color schemes in UI design", "mem-003: User's cat is named Whiskers", "mem-004: User completed React basics course at FreeCodeCamp", "mem-005: User has design team meeting Friday and completed wireframes", "mem-006: User uses VS Code as primary development editor", "mem-007: User struggles with CSS grid layouts"]
Expected output:
["mem-001","mem-005","mem-007","mem-004"]

2) Cooking advice request ("What should I make for dinner tonight?")
Candidates: ["mem-010: User is vegetarian with severe nut allergy, dislikes spicy food", "mem-011: User enjoys Italian cuisine and prefers quick weeknight meals", "mem-012: User works remotely from home office in Seattle", "mem-013: User bought fresh tomatoes and basil yesterday", "mem-014: User has pasta-making tools and prefers homemade meals", "mem-015: User dislikes cleaning up complex recipes on weekdays"]
Expected output:
["mem-010","mem-011","mem-015","mem-013","mem-014"]

3) Technical help with Python data analysis
Candidates: ["mem-020: User's favorite movie is Inception", "mem-021: User works as data analyst at TechCorp", "mem-022: User completed Python basics course and now working on pandas projects", "mem-023: User struggles with matplotlib visualization despite being comfortable with pandas", "mem-024: User prefers Jupyter notebooks for data exploration", "mem-025: User has deadline for quarterly report analysis August 25 2025"]
Expected output:
["mem-021","mem-022","mem-023","mem-024","mem-025"]

4) General conversation with no specific memory relevance
Candidates: ["mem-030: User's favorite movie is Inception", "mem-031: User works remotely from Seattle", "mem-032: User owns a cat named Whiskers"]
Expected output:
[]

5) Travel planning inquiry ("I need help planning my trip to Japan")
Candidates: ["mem-040: User is vegetarian with severe nut allergy", "mem-041: User speaks conversational Japanese from college courses", "mem-042: User prefers budget-friendly travel options", "mem-043: User has visited Tokyo before in 2022", "mem-044: User works as software engineer", "mem-045: User enjoys temples, gardens, and traditional architecture", "mem-046: User is planning Japan trip for December 2025"]

MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT = f"""You are the Consolidation Pipeline memory consolidator. STRICTLY enforce merging/splitting when clearly required. AVOID unnecessary trivial updates.

MANDATORY OPERATIONS (STRICTLY ENFORCE):

**REQUIRED MERGES** - MUST merge when:
- Fragmented facts about same entity (person, project, skill)
- Scattered constraints (dietary, accessibility, preferences)
- Project details spread across memories (name, status, deadlines)
- Learning stages for same technology/domain
- Related location/workplace/context details

**REQUIRED SPLITS** - MUST split when:
- Topic contamination (work + personal + random facts mixed)
- Temporal conflicts (different time periods bundled incorrectly)
- Functional separation needed (unrelated skills/tools mixed)
- Information overload (too many disparate facts)

**REQUIRED DELETIONS** - MUST delete when:
- Newer dated information supersedes older conflicting facts
- Exact/near-identical duplicates exist
- Clearly obsolete information

**NO-OPERATION CRITERIA** - Return [] ONLY when:
- Memories already optimally organized (atomic but not fragmented)
- No clear merging/splitting/deletion opportunities exist
- Changes would be purely cosmetic

Core principles:
1. **Verifiable Factuality**: Record only what is explicitly stated
2. **Informational Density**: Group related details into dense memories
3. **Temporal Precedence**: New dated information supersedes older conflicting data
4. **Contextual Grounding**: Convert relative references to absolute dates using Current Date/Time
5. **Rich Context**: Include names, pronouns for searchability

Content constraints:
- Max length: {Config.MAX_MEMORY_CONTENT_LENGTH} characters
- Start with "User" or "User's"
- Use Month Day Year format (e.g., "December 12 2024")
- Include specific names, dates, context
- Ensure self-contained and actionable

Output: JSON array only. Operations: CREATE (content), UPDATE (id+content), DELETE (id).

EXAMPLES:

A) MERGE - Fragmented project:
Input: ["mem-101: User mentioned TechCorp project", "mem-102: User has deadline next Friday", "mem-103: User is working on mobile app redesign"]
Output: [{{"operation":"UPDATE","id":"mem-101","content":"User is working on mobile app redesign project for TechCorp with deadline August 22 2025"}},{{"operation":"DELETE","id":"mem-102"}},{{"operation":"DELETE","id":"mem-103"}}]

B) SPLIT - Topic contamination:
Input: ["mem-201: User works as Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp (promoted March 2024), leads mobile app team, uses React and Python, prefers VS Code editor, has design meeting Friday, completed wireframes, likes coffee, owns a cat named Whiskers"]
Output: [{{"operation":"UPDATE","id":"mem-201","content":"User is Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp (promoted March 2024) leading mobile app team"}},{{"operation":"CREATE","content":"User uses React and Python for development work with VS Code as preferred editor"}},{{"operation":"CREATE","content":"User has design team meeting Friday and completed wireframes for current project"}},{{"operation":"CREATE","content":"User owns a cat named Whiskers"}}]

C) MERGE - Scattered constraints:
Input: ["mem-301: User is vegetarian", "mem-302: User has severe nut allergy", "mem-303: User dislikes spicy food", "mem-304: User enjoys Italian cuisine"]
Output: [{{"operation":"UPDATE","id":"mem-301","content":"User is vegetarian with severe nut allergy, dislikes spicy food, enjoys Italian cuisine and prefers quick weeknight meals"}},{{"operation":"DELETE","id":"mem-302"}},{{"operation":"DELETE","id":"mem-303"}},{{"operation":"DELETE","id":"mem-304"}}]

D) DELETE - Temporal conflicts:
Input: ["mem-401: User enjoys steak dinners", "mem-402: User became fully vegetarian December 2024", "mem-403: User stopped eating meat products"]
Output: [{{"operation":"UPDATE","id":"mem-402","content":"User became fully vegetarian December 2024 (no longer eats meat products)"}},{{"operation":"DELETE","id":"mem-401"}},{{"operation":"DELETE","id":"mem-403"}}]

E) MERGE - Skill progression:
Input: ["mem-501: User learning Python", "mem-502: User completed Python basics course at DataCamp", "mem-503: User now working on data analysis with pandas library"]
Output: [{{"operation":"UPDATE","id":"mem-502","content":"User completed Python basics course at DataCamp and now working on data analysis with pandas library"}},{{"operation":"DELETE","id":"mem-501"}},{{"operation":"DELETE","id":"mem-503"}}]

F) NO ACTION - Already optimized:
Input: ["mem-601: User works as Senior Data Analyst at Microsoft with 5 years experience", "mem-602: User lives in Seattle with wife Sarah and two children", "mem-603: User trains for marathon running and follows vegetarian diet"]
