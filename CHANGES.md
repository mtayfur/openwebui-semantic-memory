# Simplification of `_should_skip_memory_operations` and `_should_enhance_query` Functions

## Overview

We've simplified the `_should_skip_memory_operations` and `_should_enhance_query` functions in `memory.py` to make them more readable and maintainable while preserving their core functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. `_should_enhance_query` Function

**Original Complexity:**
- Complex scoring system with multiple thresholds
- 9 different criteria contributing to a score
- Required a score of 3 or more to trigger enhancement

**Simplified Approach:**
- Eliminated the complex scoring mechanism
- Clearer decision logic based on natural language characteristics
- More straightforward conditions:
  1. Skip if too short (Config.MIN_QUERY_LENGTH)
  2. Skip obvious code patterns
  3. Use text profile for detailed analysis
  4. Enhance if it looks like natural language with substance:
     - Multiple sentences OR questions OR
     - Long enough with good uniqueness ratio

### 2. `_should_skip_memory_operations` Function

**Original Complexity:**
- Multiple early returns making flow hard to follow
- Redundant checks scattered throughout

**Simplified Approach:**
- Improved code organization and readability
- Clearer flow of checks:
  1. Skip if empty or too long
  2. Skip obvious code patterns
  3. Check for code/structured data patterns
  4. Use text profile for detailed analysis
  5. Skip based on content characteristics

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability:** The logic is now easier to understand at a glance
2. **Easier Maintenance:** Simplified conditions are easier to modify or extend
3. **Same Functionality:** All core behavior is preserved
4. **Better Organization:** Clearer separation of concerns in the decision process

## Testing

We've thoroughly tested the changes with:
1. Unit tests for edge cases
2. Realistic user scenario tests
3. Consistency verification against expected behaviors
4. Syntax and compilation checks

All tests pass, confirming that the simplified functions maintain the intended behavior.
